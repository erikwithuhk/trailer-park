## Problem Statement:

Movie and TV platforms’ recommender systems are a hit or miss (Partly caused by all of the anime films watched by one of the nine friends who share your account.)  

Trailer Park allows users to create a collection of trailers by simply searching movies and shows and saving them to a personalized library.  Users can also curate Movie/TV playlists based on other Trailer Park users and their Trailer Libraries.


## User Scenario

All of Mike’s coworkers are talking about how they are watching Stranger Things. He is feeling left out because he thinks he is last to know about every show (he only just discovered Game of Thrones).  Separately, another colleague, Alice, is frustrated by her movie suggestions that show up on her favorite movie/TV providers… She spends hours each week to reading critic reviews and to diving into independent movie blogs in order to save a note on her computer with some possible movies her (obscure) dark taste might enjoy.  Their mutual friend recommends that they join this new site called Trailer Park to be able to easily discover movies and shows based on common interests and preferences.  Trailer Park takes away the social anxiety of being the last to watch something and the hours long search for niche films.

As a new user, you want to sign into the site, search movies or shows you’re interested in, and add Trailers (content) to your every-changing and updating profile.

### Problems:
- Always looking for stuff to watch
- Don't want to sift through reviews
- Want credibility from your choice of credible sources
- And don't want to be the last one in your group to watch something
- Love watching trailers in theatres but always forget to write down which movies you want to see

## Coming Soon!
- Influencers / Spotlight Curators - Highlighted in the Trailer Park Community
- Increasing the social component functionality and recommendation system
